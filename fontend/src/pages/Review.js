                The team is well organised and arrived within 1 hour of making
                the call about donation. They administered the food , came in
                their own vehicle n gathered food in own utensils ..hasslefree
                food pick up.. definitely would suggest for others to use this
                NGO if you have untouched safe food to donate
              </p>

                It is a fantastic job..It is also not easy to do this kind of
                work bcz nowasdays ppl always busy with thier work untill they
                didn't hv a time to think abt others..so, whatever you guys did
                is outstanding..May god bless you all always.
